  <div class="intro-body">
    <p><a href="https://github.com/lattice-substrate/json-canon">json-canon</a> is a Go library for <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785">RFC 8785</a> JSON Canonicalization Scheme. It exists because deterministic serialization is a harder problem than it appears — and because the infrastructure that depends on it deserves more than <em>the tests pass</em> as a correctness argument.</p>
    <p>These articles document what it took to build: the algorithms, the parser, the architectural decisions that separate a library from dependable infrastructure, and the evidence-based release process that proves the output is actually deterministic. Each article is self-contained, but together they trace the full arc from specification compliance to provable correctness.</p>
